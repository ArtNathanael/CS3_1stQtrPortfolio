## List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with two to five sentences.



## List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why. The why should be per topic listed.  



## Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.

1. Firstly, I will read the materials regarding these lessons. Aside from just reading the materials, I will try to research online more about these topics along with watching videos, in order to further deepen my understanding.

2. Then, I shall actually apply what I have learned which will ensure that my 'understanding' will become 'mastery'. I will probably either search practice exercises online or ask ChatGPT to give me prompts regarding these topics which I will solve, so that I may actually ensure that what I have learned stays as a memory. After all, practice and application is the best way to learn, and without those, theory and simple reading will simply make it so that your brain might have a shallow and surface-level understanding of the topic, but it will not truly know why those things occur. It can know how a function works, but not why a function works, and in my opinion, the latter is far more important. With that, I can master the topics. 

## In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?

1. I think that the two most effective activities were probably the two speed tests. Since it had a bonus, it incenvitized me to truly try my best, and since the topic was still fresh in my mind, I was able to easily apply it into the prompts, allowing me to ingrain those topics in my brain.

2. In the contrary, I did not like the two Kahoot Quizzes too much. Although these may work for others, I was not motivated to truly answer the questions properly for the quizzes, and due to the timings of these quizzes, my memories were cluttered, and I had frequent brain farts, which are not effective in actual studying.
